Home Task: Product Catalog & Reviews Application Overview Develop a mini product catalog where users can browse products and add reviews. The primary focus is on building a robust, visually appealing, and well-tested frontend. Use a database to store products and reviews, and expose a backend API to interact with the data. Requirements Project Setup
● Set up a modern frontend application using Next.js and React.
● Use a styling approach that ensures maintainability and scalability.
● Document and test your UI components using a component-driven development approach. Frontend Functionality (≈70% Focus)
● Homepage: Display a list of products with essential details.
● Product Detail Page: Show detailed product info and existing reviews. Allow users to submit new reviews.
● Component Design: Break the UI into reusable components (e.g., ProductCard, ProductList, ReviewForm).
● State Management & API Calls: Fetch product and review data from the backend using an appropriate client. Backend Functionality (≈30% Focus)
● Implement an API to handle:
○ Retrieving product and review data.
○ Submitting new reviews.
● Store the data in a database and structure it efficiently. General Best Practices
● Code Quality: Clean, modular, and maintainable code.
● Error Handling: Handle errors gracefully on both client and server.
● Responsive UI: Ensure a smooth experience across different screen sizes.
● Documentation: Provide clear setup and running instructions. Bonus Points
● Writing tests for key functionalities (unit, integration, or e2e).
● Deploying the application and providing a live demo. Deliverables
● Share a Git repository link containing the source code.
● Include a README with setup instructions and any additional notes.
